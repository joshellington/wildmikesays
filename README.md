# HTML Boilerplate

[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) is wonderful, but 4-space tabs, bloated CSS, Modernizr, extra Apple icons, and ant build scripts are not my cup of tea. So I maintain this heavily inspired version.

Uses [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for SCSS and CoffeeScript compilation. Setup to be pretty dumb at the moment.

Very basic SCSS utilities and mixins. May expand in the future.

Pulls in jQuery by default. Take it out if necessary.
